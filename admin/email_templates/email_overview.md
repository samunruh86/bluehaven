# **Distributor Outreach and Email Strategy**

### **Overview**
This unified guide combines Amazon Wholesale reach-out best practices with outreach templates. It’s designed to help you **find and secure distributors**, **craft compelling outreach**, and **position your company as a trusted partner** for both brands and suppliers.

---

## **1. How to Find and Secure Distributors**
Distribution is a foundational, often underused, pillar of a profitable Amazon wholesale business. Distributors offer reliable inventory streams and serve as a bridge toward direct brand accounts. Mature sellers often have **25–33%** of their catalog sourced from distributors.

### **Primary Paths to Find Distributors**

#### **1. Brand Referrals (Most Effective)**
1. Reach out to brands through email or phone.  
2. If they decline to open a direct account, ask:  
   > “Totally understand — do you happen to have a list of your authorized distribution partners we can reach out to?”
3. Around 75% of brands will provide this list.  
4. Then contact those distributors:  
   > “[C_BRAND] referred me to purchase their products directly from you. How can we get an account set up today?”

**Why It Works:** Mentioning a brand name establishes instant credibility. Distributors rarely object when the brand itself has referred you.

#### **2. Google Search**
- Search by niche + “distributor” + region (e.g., “beauty distributor California”).  
- Look for distributors near your prep center or warehouse for efficiency.  
- Visit their websites, identify which brands they carry, and use a variation of the referral script:  
  > “We work closely with [C_BRAND] and were referred to purchase through you. What’s the process to get started?”

Even without a formal referral, referencing a brand they already distribute builds trust.

### **Key Success Principles**
- **Stay High on the Supply Chain** – Work as close to the brand as possible for better pricing, cleaner invoices, and long-term legitimacy.  
- **Verify Authorization** – Always confirm a distributor’s legitimacy directly with the brand to avoid compliance issues.  
- **Go Deep, Not Wide** – Focus on building meaningful, consistent relationships with a few reliable distributors rather than spreading thin across many.  
- **Keep It Simple** – Many distributor accounts can be opened with one confident, well-crafted message.  
- **Understand Their Incentives** – Distributors value reliable partners who order regularly, communicate clearly, and pay on time. Create urgency with a statement like: “I’m ready to place a $10,000 PO this week — just need to get set up.”  
- **Personalization Wins** – Successful outreach relies on value-driven communication, professionalism, and persistence.  
- **Depth Over Breadth** – Building trust and consistent communication leads to stronger, longer-lasting partnerships.  
- **Act Like a Partner, Not a Buyer** – Position [U_COMPANY] as a value-adding partner who helps strengthen brand presence, not just a reseller looking for profit.

## **2. Outreach Strategy Overview**

### **Email Outreach**
Email is the most scalable first touchpoint. Since brands and suppliers receive hundreds of daily requests, your message must stand out through **value and specificity**.  
Provide clear advantages — show data, highlight efficiency, and explain why working with [U_COMPANY] benefits them.

### **Call Outreach**
Treat every call as a sales conversation. Prepare deeply — research their catalog, pricing, and competitive presence. Confidence and preparation make the difference.

### **Follow-Up**
If no reply after **2 business days**:
- Follow an email with a call.  
- If you left a voicemail, send this short email:

Hello,
This is [C_FNAME] [C_LNAME] from [U_COMPANY], a wholesale, distributor, and retail company.
I tried reaching you at [phone number] and would love to discuss opportunities to bring mutual value.
What day works best for a quick call?
Best,
Sam
