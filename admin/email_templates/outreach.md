# Wholesale Outreach Playbook

> Use this playbook to prepare, contact, and win new wholesale relationships with brands and distributors. Internalize the structure, then speak naturally—every interaction should feel like a conversation, not a memorized script.

---

## 1. Outreach Mindset
- Lead with rapport. Open every conversation with genuine curiosity before moving into business.
- Sound human. Treat the frameworks here as guardrails and adapt them to the person in front of you.
- Stay flexible. Listen for buying signals, objections, or new information and adjust in real time.
- Act like a partner. Position [YOUR_COMPANY] as a long-term ally who grows sales, protects brand integrity, and communicates clearly.

---

## 2. Preparation Checklist
Before emailing or calling, gather proof that you add value:
- Confirm the brand’s current Amazon presence, catalog gaps, and MAP policy status.
- Pull data (SmartScout, Keepa, search volume, competitive landscape) that supports improved sales or operational efficiency.
- Identify logistics strengths: warehouse capacity, prep capabilities, fulfillment speeds, and geographic advantages.
- Clarify purchasing power: ready-to-commit PO size, reorder cadence, working capital.
- Map decision-maker info (email, phone, LinkedIn) and note any brand-specific talking points or mutual connections.

---

## 3. Value Propositions to Highlight
Reference these throughout emails and calls to demonstrate why partnering with [YOUR_COMPANY] is different:
- Proven sales performance: [Enter yearly revenue] across the US, Canada, and Mexico with monthly purchasing volumes exceeding [Enter purchasing volume].
- Dedicated reinvestment: 5–20% of profits cycled into brand-specific advertising to expand visibility and velocity.
- Expert listing management: keyword research, PPC strategy, A+ Content, creative asset refreshes, and growth on marketplaces beyond Amazon (Walmart, eBay, Shopify).
- Operational reliability: in-house warehouse, trained prep team, and streamlined logistics for fast and compliant fulfillment.
- Compliance and protection: strict MAP adherence, unauthorized seller mitigation, and transparent communication.

---

## 4. Multi-Channel Outreach Strategy

### Email First, Phone Second
1. **Initial Email** — concise value story plus a clear call to action (CTA).
2. **Follow-Up Call** — reference the email, deepen discovery, and guide them toward onboarding.
3. **Rhythmic Follow-Ups** — mix email, phone, and voicemail. If two business days pass without a response, call and send a short bump email referencing the voicemail.

### Success Principles
- Personalization wins attention; lead with insights specific to their brand or product line.
- Be explicit about next steps (e.g., “Can we schedule 15 minutes tomorrow to review onboarding?”).
- Demonstrate urgency without pressure by highlighting purchase readiness (“We’re ready to place a $10K+ PO this week.”).

## 5. Call Conversation Framework
Use this structure for both brand and distributor calls; tailor the proof points to the audience.

- *Warm Opening*  
  “Hi [FIRST_NAME], this is [YOUR_NAME] with [YOUR_COMPANY]. Appreciate you taking the time—how’s your day going so far?”

- *Context & Credibility*  
  “We’re a wholesale, distribution, and e-commerce retailer focused on elevating brand performance across Amazon and other marketplaces. We currently manage [Enter yearly revenue] in annual sales and reinvest 5–20% back into advertising for the brands we represent.”

- *Discovery & Alignment*  
  Ask two or three open-ended questions:  
  “How are you currently managing online retail partners?”  
  “What does success look like when you add a new wholesale account?”  
  “Are there SKUs you’d like to move more aggressively or keep better control over?”

- *Value Delivery*  
  Connect your capabilities to their needs: highlight listing optimization, compliance discipline, logistics strength, and willingness to place significant opening orders or support backup inventory for 1P sellers.

- *Clear Close*  
  “We’re ready to meet any MOQs and move quickly. Could you walk me through the steps to get a wholesale account approved?”  
  “What documents do you need from us today so we can place our opening PO?”

- *Next Step Confirmation*  
  Recap decisions, confirm timelines, and set expectations for follow-up. Send a recap email immediately after the call.

## 6. Email Frameworks & Templates
Customize every template with specific brand, distributor, and product insights. Keep signatures professional and include best contact details.

### A. Initial Brand Outreach
```
Subject: Unlocking New Sales for [BRAND_NAME]

Hi [FIRST_NAME],

I’m [YOUR_NAME], founder of [YOUR_COMPANY]. We’ve been tracking [BRAND_NAME]’s momentum and see room to amplify your reach on Amazon, Walmart, and direct-to-consumer channels.

We typically start partnerships with a $10K+ opening PO and simultaneously:

- Protect MAP while removing unauthorized sellers.
- Reinvest 5–20% of our profits into paid ads and influencer campaigns to accelerate velocity.

Are you currently onboarding additional retail partners? I’d love to schedule 15 minutes to review how we can support your roadmap.

Best,  
[SIGNATURE]

```
Subject: Fast-Track Partnership for [PRODUCT_LINE]

Hi [FIRST_NAME],

I’m a long-time fan of [PRODUCT_LINE] and would like to bring it into our catalog at [YOUR_COMPANY]. We manage [Enter yearly revenue] in annual sales and have allocation ready for a $15K opening PO this month.

I’ve attached our initial PO draft and a quick audit outlining keyword, review, and creative opportunities that could grow your sales 20%+ in the next two quarters.

Can we connect for 20 minutes this week to walk through onboarding?

Thank you,  
[SIGNATURE]

What’s the best next step to move forward?

Best,

## 7. Handling Common Objections
Prepare talking points before every conversation so you can pivot smoothly.

### “We already have too many Amazon sellers.”
- **Why they say it:** They’re protecting margin and avoiding channel conflict.
- **How to respond:** Emphasize that you expand the total sales pie with advertising, A+ Content, listing rehab, and launch strategies—position yourself as the partner who grows revenue, not just splits existing demand.

### “Sellers don’t follow MAP.”
- **Why they say it:** Past experiences with price erosion and compliance issues.
- **How to respond:** Share examples of MAP programs you actively enforce, offer to monitor pricing, and commit to escalation protocols. Reference brands where you’ve maintained pricing discipline.

### “We work 1P with Amazon.”
- **Why they say it:** Amazon already buys directly, so they see little need for more sellers.
- **How to respond:** Offer to be a backup when Amazon is out of stock or declines POs, keeping the brand in stock and protecting ranking. Acknowledge it’s a supplemental strategy and ask to stay on file for overflow orders.

### “We handle our own FBA.”
- **Why they say it:** They believe controlling the channel internally gives them the best outcome.
- **How to respond:** Only pursue if multiple sellers are already involved. Present collaborative ideas (bundle creation, international expansion, seasonal support) and show how you augment their team during peak periods.

### “We have an exclusive Amazon partner.”
- **Why they say it:** They’re contractually tied to one seller.
- **How to respond:** Respect the relationship, then ask what success metrics they hold the partner to. If there are gaps (stockouts, poor creative, MAP issues), demonstrate how you would outperform and request consideration when the contract renews.

## 8. Relationship-Building Habits
- Recap every call with written next steps, agreed timelines, and required documents.
- Deliver on every promise quickly—speed builds trust.
- Keep communication proactive: share sales insights, ad performance, and competitive updates without being asked.
- Focus on depth over breadth. A handful of strong distributor and brand relationships will outperform dozens of shallow ones.
- Track outreach, objections, and follow-ups in your CRM so nothing falls through the cracks.

Internalize the points above, customize the messaging to your voice, and stay consistent. Professionalism, persistence, and real value are what win high-quality wholesale partnerships.
