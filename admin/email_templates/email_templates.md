Hi [C_FNAME],  

I’m [C_FNAME] [C_LNAME], founder of [U_COMPANY]. We’ve been tracking [C_BRAND]’s momentum and see room to amplify your reach on Amazon, Walmart, and direct-to-consumer channels.  

We typically start partnerships with a $10K+ opening PO and simultaneously:  
- Refresh product detail pages with data-backed copy, A+ Content, and new creative.  
- Protect MAP while removing unauthorized sellers.  
- Reinvest 5–20% of our profits into paid ads and influencer campaigns to accelerate velocity.  

Are you currently onboarding additional retail partners? I’d love to schedule 15 minutes to review how we can support your roadmap.  

Best,  
[SIGNATURE]

Hi [C_FNAME],

I’ve attached our initial PO draft and a quick audit outlining keyword, review, and creative opportunities that could grow your sales 20%+ in the next two quarters.  

Can we connect for 20 minutes this week to walk through onboarding?  

Thank you,
