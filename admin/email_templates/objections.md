# **Objection Handling Guide**

## **Guide Overview**
When reaching out to suppliers, you will face objections; for most of the brands you contact, you won’t secure your first email. There will be an objection that you have to overcome.  
This guide outlines common objections, why they occur, and how to effectively address them to move forward.

## **Objections You May Face (and Why)**

1. **Too Many Amazon Sellers**  
   Brands often say they’re “not taking on additional Amazon sellers.”  
   Think of Amazon sales as a pizza: the brand’s total sales stay the same, but each new seller makes the slices smaller—more work for less reward and more risk of bad actors.

2. **Unprofessional Sellers Ignoring MAP Policies**  
   Brands are frustrated by sellers who undercut Minimum Advertised Price (MAP) policies. This causes complaints from compliant sellers and brick-and-mortar stores who can’t compete with online pricing.

3. **First-Party (1P) Sellers**  
   Some companies sell directly to Amazon (1P). These brands have little reason to work with third-party resellers.

4. **Brands with Their Own FBA Accounts**  
   Some brands handle their own FBA operations. These can be difficult to approach unless they also work with multiple sellers.

5. **Exclusive Seller Contracts**  
   A brand may already have an exclusive Amazon partnership and be contractually bound to a single seller.

## **How to Address These Objections**

1. **Grow Their Sales Pie**  
   Emphasize that you want to *increase* their total sales, not just take a slice. Offer:
   - PPC campaigns on their listings  
   - A+ Content / Enhanced Brand Content  
   - Listing optimization (images, titles, bullet points, keywords, videos)  
   - Launching products not yet listed on Amazon  
   - Expansion to eBay, Walmart, Shopify, and more  
   The goal is to show that working with you benefits them beyond a simple sale.

2. **Show Professionalism & Compliance**  
   Explain that you always follow brand policies. Provide examples or references from current partners where you maintain proper pricing and compliance.

3. **Offer Backup Stock Support**  
   For 1P sellers, propose serving as a reliable backup when Amazon runs out of stock. This is a niche, low-success strategy—but potentially lucrative.

4. **Selective Collaboration with FBA Brands**  
   Only contact brands with their own FBA accounts if you see multiple other sellers. Some may be open to collaboration; others won’t.

5. **Navigating Exclusive Partnerships**  
   Ask if they’re satisfied with their current seller. If not, identify weaknesses in that partnership and demonstrate how you can perform better—then follow through.

## **General Talking Points When Facing Objections**

Especially as a new seller, you must **create value** for brands to stand out among hundreds of outreach emails.  
Here are key ways to differentiate yourself:

1. **Bring Data**  
   - Show listing review counts and identify areas for improvement.  
   - Share competitor insights to support ad campaigns.  
   - Present search term opportunities for targeting.  
   - Provide a **SmartScout Brand Data PDF** as a value-add to showcase your analytics access.  
   - Offer multi-channel expansion (eBay, Walmart, Amazon Canada, etc.).

These elevate your message from *“Can we buy your product?”* to *“Here’s how we can help you sell more.”*  
Demonstrating that you can grow their sales increases trust and response rates.
